# Pipeline Library Architecture Document

## Overview
This document details the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details of the generic pipeline library.

## 1. Data Structures Used and Reasoning

### 1.1 Core Data Structures

#### Pipeline
```go
type Pipeline struct {
	Config             *Config
	Stages             []Stage
	metrics            *metrics.MetricsCollector
	id                 string
	lastProcessingTime time.Duration
}
```
- **Reasoning**: Central structure that maintains configuration, stages, and metrics
- **Benefits**: 
  - Encapsulates all pipeline-related data
  - Allows for easy extension and monitoring
  - Maintains a clear separation of concerns

#### Config
```go
type Config struct {
	BatchSize       int
	Workers         int
	BatchTimeout    time.Duration
	MaxRetries      int
	RetryDelay      time.Duration
	BufferSize      int
	DynamicBatching bool
	MetricsEnabled  bool
}
```
- **Reasoning**: Centralizes all configurable parameters
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy to modify behavior without code changes
  - Supports dynamic adjustments at runtime
  - Clear documentation of all tunable parameters

### 1.2 Stage Implementations

Each stage type (Map, Reduce, Filter, etc.) implements the Stage interface:
```go
type Stage interface {
    Process(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) (interface{}, error)
}
```

- **Reasoning**: Interface-based design for maximum flexibility
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy to add new stage types
  - Consistent processing pattern
  - Type-safe through Go generics

## 2. Algorithm Used and Reasoning

### 2.1 Main Processing Algorithm

1. **Batching Strategy**
   - Events are grouped into configurable batch sizes
   - Dynamic batch size adjustment based on processing metrics
   - Helps balance throughput and latency

2. **Worker Pool Pattern**
   ```go
   workerPool := make(chan struct{}, p.Config.Workers)
   ```
   - Fixed pool of workers processes batches concurrently
   - Prevents resource exhaustion
   - Maintains controlled parallelism

3. **Pipeline Processing**
   - Each event flows through stages sequentially
   - Results from each stage feed into the next
   - Supports branching logic through If stages

### 2.2 Dynamic Batch Size Algorithm
```go
func (p *Pipeline) adjustBatchSize() {
    if p.metrics.ProcessingTime > time.Second {
        p.Config.BatchSize = max(p.Config.BatchSize/2, 10)
    } else if p.metrics.ProcessingTime < time.Millisecond*100 {
        p.Config.BatchSize = min(p.Config.BatchSize*2, 1000)
    }
}
```
- **Reasoning**: Automatically adjusts batch size based on processing time
- **Benefits**:
  - Optimizes throughput
  - Adapts to varying load conditions
  - Maintains reasonable latency

## 3. Interfaces Design and Reasoning

### 3.1 Core Interfaces

#### Stage Interface
```go
type Stage interface {
    Process(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) (interface{}, error)
}
```
- **Reasoning**: Fundamental building block for pipeline stages
- **Benefits**:
  - Simple to implement
  - Flexible input/output types
  - Context support for cancellation

### 3.2 Generic Stage Implementations

Each stage type uses Go generics for type safety:
```go
type MapStage[T any] struct {
    Fn func(T) T
}
```
- **Reasoning**: Type-safe transformations with generic types
- **Benefits**:
  - Compile-time type checking
  - Reusable across different data types
  - Clear function signatures

## 4. Areas for Improvement and Potential Optimizations

### 4.1 Performance Optimizations
1. **Memory Pool**
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Reduce GC pressure
   - Reuse allocations for better performance

2. **Batch Size Optimization**
   - More sophisticated dynamic batching algorithm
   - Consider system resources (CPU, memory)
   - ML-based/predictive optimizations

### 4.2 Feature Enhancements
1. **Error Handling**
   - More sophisticated retry mechanisms
   - Dead letter queues for failed events
   - Better error reporting and metrics

2. **Monitoring**
   - Detailed performance metrics
   - Real-time pipeline statistics

## 5. Benchmarking Results

The library has been benchmarked with two types of events:
1. TestStruct (10 properties)
2. MableEvent (complex nested structure)

Results are available in `pipeline_library_benchmarks.csv`

Key findings:
- Near-linear memory scaling across all event sizes
- Processing time scales non-linearly after 10,000 events
- Consistent allocation patterns (~20 allocs per event)
